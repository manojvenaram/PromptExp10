# Experiment 10: Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Aim:
The aim of this experiment is to demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books using AI models like ChatGPT. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the quality, coherence, and structure of the generated content.

## Procedure:
1. **Introduction to Prompt Patterns**:
   Understand the following prompt patterns:
   - **Query Decomposition**: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
   - **Decision Making**: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
   - **Answer Engineering**: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
   - **Fact Check List**: Ensuring content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
   - **Tail Generation**: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
   - **Menu Actions**: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
   - **Semantic Filter**: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.

2. **Choosing the Content Type**:
   Decide on the type of content you want to create. Possible content types include:
   - Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports)
   - Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
   - Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
   - Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)

3. **Content Example Scenarios**:
   You can choose from these scenarios to test content generation:
   - Business Report on Market Trends
   - Case Study on Business Success
   - Article on Climate Change
   - Creative Writing - Sci-Fi Short Story
   - Educational Report on Renewable Energy
   - Product Launch Announcement
   - Travel Blog Post
   - Research Paper on Artificial Intelligence
   - Interview Transcript for Documentary
   - Sustainability Practices in Fashion
   - How to Build an E-commerce Website
   - Social Issue Awareness Campaign
   - Artificial Intelligence Impact on Healthcare

4. **Creating the Prompts**:
   - Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
   - Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making, tail generation, and semantic filtering.
   
5. **Generating and Refining Outputs**:
   - Use the model to generate initial drafts, then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments.
   - For a report, start with basic data, then ask for deeper analysis and insights.
   - For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.

6. **Review and Evaluation**:
   After generating content, evaluate the outputs based on:
   - **Coherence**: Is the content logically structured?
   - **Creativity/Originality**: Is the content engaging and fresh?
   - **Accuracy**: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
   - **Tone and Style**: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## Test Case Scenarios for Content Generation (Use Any 2):
### Test Case Scenario 1: Business Report on Market Trends
1. **Initial Prompt (Basic)**: 
   - "Generate a business report on the current market trends in the renewable energy sector."
   
2. **Refined Prompt (Using Decision Making)**:
   - "Generate a business report on the current market trends in renewable energy, comparing solar, wind, and geothermal energy. Which sector shows the highest growth potential in the next 5 years?"
   
3. **Refined Prompt (Using Tail Generation)**:
   - "Generate a business report on the market trends in renewable energy, focusing on solar energy’s market share and growth trajectory. Extend the content with projections for the next decade."
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - **Coherence**: Ensure logical flow with clear sections (e.g., introduction, analysis, projections).
   - **Creativity/Originality**: Provide unique insights into market trends.
   - **Accuracy**: Fact-check data on renewable energy market trends.
   - **Tone and Style**: Maintain a formal tone with clear and concise writing.

### Test Case Scenario 2: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story
1. **Initial Prompt (Basic)**: 
   - "Write a short sci-fi story set in a futuristic city where technology has advanced to the point of controlling the weather."
   
2. **Refined Prompt (Using Decision Making)**:
   - "Write a sci-fi short story set in a futuristic city where technology controls the weather. The protagonist, a scientist, must decide whether to use the technology to prevent a natural disaster or allow it to happen."
   
3. **Refined Prompt (Using Semantic Filter)**:
   - "Write a suspenseful and dark sci-fi short story set in a futuristic city with weather-controlling technology. The protagonist must make an ethical decision, with a plot twist at the end that challenges their beliefs."
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - **Coherence**: Ensure the plot has a clear beginning, middle, and end.
   - **Creativity/Originality**: Ensure the story is fresh and engaging.
   - **Accuracy**: While fictional, ensure the technological concepts are plausible.
   - **Tone and Style**: Match the tone (suspenseful and dark) throughout the story.

## Deliverables:
1. **First Draft**: A basic draft of the report, case study, article, or story generated using simple prompts.
2. **Refined Content**: A more detailed and structured output, achieved by applying advanced prompt techniques.
3. **Multiple Versions**: Different versions of the content, showing the effect of prompt changes on the output.
4. **Final Version**: The polished version of the content after incorporating feedback and refining the prompts.

## Conclusion:
By applying various prompting techniques, you can generate high-quality content for a wide range of use cases, from business reports and case studies to creative works like short stories and articles. This experiment demonstrates how structured prompting can guide AI models like ChatGPT to create coherent, accurate, and engaging outputs tailored to specific needs.
